    "What rolls down stairs alone or in pairs
    rolls over your neighbor's dog?
    What's great for a snack and fits on your back?
    It's Log, Log, Log!

    It's Log, Log, it's big, it's heavy, it's wood.
    It's Log, Log, it's better than bad, it's good!

    Come on and get your log! Everyone needs a Log!"
